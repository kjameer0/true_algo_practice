Given = array of words of varying frequencies, k = top
k frequent words should be returned
return array of top k words sorted in lexicographical order
Solution 1:
Time Complexity: O(n * log(k))
Space Complexity: O(n)
Concepts: Priority Queue, Heap, Hash Table, sorting
Algorithm:
1. Create a hash Table
  Why? to store every word and its frequency
  the frequency is the primary way of sorting the array
2. Create Priority Queue
  Why? the Priority Queue will be taking every word and making sure
  that they are stored in an order that will be correct when
  we are polling from the top
3. Create Priority Queue comparison function
  Queue needs to take input and place it in the right spot
  so it has to take the element and put the lower frequencies near the top and sort in lexicographical order if frequencies are different
4. enqueue
  Why? start adding values from table to queue, this will allow it
  such that queue will sort values. when queue size is bigger than k, dequeue because the words we want will be towards the bottom.
