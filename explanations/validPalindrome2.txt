notes:
the trick to this problem entails using a helper function.
the helper function checks whether a given string at certain indices is a palidrome.
so when you see two letters not matching, you can either delete the char at the left or right pointer.
by checking if either substring is a palidrome, you can effectively delete a single character and check whether or not the original string can have a single character deleted.
