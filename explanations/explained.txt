1. top k frequent elements
  - array heap problem
  - solution: record frequencies in Map
    - create array of same size as original
    - store which numbers have i frequency in an array at index i
    - loop k times and add those keys to results
  - Space- 1 map O(n) frequencies O(n) res O(n)
2.word pattern
  - hashing problem
  - get all strings from spaced string
  - create 2 maps
  - loop first string
