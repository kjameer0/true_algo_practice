Question:
Given : non-empty array of pairs. each individual pair has a start and an end where end >= start. the array is unsorted
ex:
[
  [1, 2],[3, 5],[4, 7],[6, 8], [9, 10]
]
theory:
1. if you sort the array by ascending order of start values
2. if you loop through that sorted array
3. if you create a result array

you can compare one interval in the array to the next
if they can merge
  merge them
  make the next value you compare this new verge value
otherwise
  you can move the current value you're looking at onto the
  result array(whether or not it has been merged)
  you can set the new value to be compared to be next value in the array

after the loop you can just drop the last current value into
the result and return it
